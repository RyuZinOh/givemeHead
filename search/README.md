### search_char_indices()
- we will be doing this in safe limit of 100 occurances && this is a linear search method [starts from 0 and checks everything]
- we pass the string and our target character which will be read only and as a pointer we will be moving through its indices and our target for a match
- we loop through the string with our condition to match our target at each string indices, when matched we store the index in array
- at last we return the total number of occurance in indexarray inital and rest are their positions
