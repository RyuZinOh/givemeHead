### reverse_string()
- finds the length of the string
- swaps the first to last position starts from first position moving towards the middle
- stops when we reach middle

### reverse_array()
- takes the array and its length
- now swaps the first index to last index moving towards the middle
- stops when we reach middle 

## reverse_int()
- takes the input number as parameter
- make it positive
- run it on the loop until it gets reduced to 0 with n/10 at each loop 
- get the last digit of the number 
- add the last digit at last with rev*10 + digit with reverse initilization once
- reduce it at loop for other loop 
- return the negative/postive reverse integer of input
